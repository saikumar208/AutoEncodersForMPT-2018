Use of Neural Networks (Autoencoding) for Stock Picking for the implementation of the Markovitz Portfolio Theory

One of the major obstacles faced in financial forecasts is the dimensionality problem. Therefore, if
we can pick stocks with smaller reconstruction errors, then any financial technique tried on them
should work better. The Markovitz Theorem gets affected by the same problem, we hence are trying
to find out if better results can be obtained if we use stocks with smaller reconstruction error.
